# Readme-Icons

> Currated by [@Andre601][andre601]

Welcome to the Readme-Icons Repository!  
This Repository aims to provide various SVG icons to use in your Readme, or any other markdown file.

## How to use
This Repository has a `icons` folder containing other folders, which sort the SVG icons into different categories.  
To use a SVG icon, simply use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons/main/icons/ followed by the folder, icon name and `.svg` extension.

The link would be used like any other image through the Image Markdown format (`![text](link)`).

## Licenses

Please note that the different icons may have different licenses. Each folder in the `icons` directory is equipped with a copy of the respective license(s) used.

## Why use this and not the actual source?

There are many reasons why you should use this repository and not the source of the SVG directly.  
The first one being that the SVG icons here may be colored compared to their often white/black counter parts available in source, which may not look good everywhere and often cannot be recoloured that easy.  
Additionally is it easier to have a single source compared to multiple ones.  
And finally, can you use versions from a specific point in time, thanks to GitHub keeping instances of images saved under specific commit hashes.

## Icons

Here is a complete list of all categories and their available icons.  
The source and respective license(s) will be linked.

### Octicons

Octicons are GitHubs own SVG icons used across their website but also in various software.  
The default icons are white and have been recolored based on GitHub's colour scheme used.

All icons used are the 16px variant available, which fit perfectly in normal text.
