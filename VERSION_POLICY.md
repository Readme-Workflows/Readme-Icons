# Readme Icons Version Policy
We use releases to allow you to use a specific instance of an icon in case it was changed or even removed.

The Releases of this repository follow basic [Semantic Versioning][semver] with a few specific changes regarding when what part of a version is receiving an update.  
The version format is `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and follows the following Update-rules:

- **Major** is updated whenever a new set of icons is added to or an existing icon set is removed from the [`icons`][icons] folder.
- **Minor** is updated whenever new icons are added to an existing icon set or existing ones are removed. This also includes the simple renaming of an icon.
- **Patch** is updated for when an existing icon receives (visual) changes that don't affect the URL it is accessible through (i.e. no renaming).
